Upto 1430
+ Adding geolocation to original eztfl had previously been on it's
todo list. On reflection, it warrants a new project so here we go.
1430
Decide the itch to be scratched. Namely, a site that looks at where
 I am, where I'm going, and where I'll be, then use that info to
 offer bus stop suggestions.
Decide new project name, eztfl-html5
Decide do it "publicly", maybe even youtube aspects later
Decision to create as website rather than app
Introducing TFL.
Introducing me as dev and the tools I'll use.
HTTPS as a mandatory constraint
2045
The neccessity for github
Migrate existing two files to https://github.com/Csi18nAlistairMann/eztfl-html5
Rearrange authentication from un/pw to public key
2144
Create a file to track resources used (docs/Resources)
1136x640 as a voluntary constraint on the CSS displayport
Create a file to track project objectives (docs/Goals)
Move eztfl-html5\ diary to docs/Diary
Move eztfl-html5\ thoughts to docs/Thoughts
Introduce the project is at immediate risk for reasons we don't yet know
What constitutes project success?
List Known Unknowns that need to be addressed befor project starts

0026
Plan for handling Known Unknowns
Add DNS entry for eztfl-html5.mpsvr.com
Add Apache entry for eztfl-html5.mpsvr.com
Resolve Unknown Unknown #1: which email address subdomain admin for
	apache
Discover Unknown Unknown #2: How to get site to pull only parts of
	 the gh repo
1119
Add JavaScript page at /uu2.html that displays position, accuracy
    speed and heading
Add docs/UnknownUnknowns to track unexpected workloads
Discover Unknown Unknown #3: accuracy is also available, which could
	 feed into processing decisions
Investigate whether devices can report speed/heading data
Investigate whether that's my bad interpretation by contrast with newer
	    devices
Discover Unknown Unknown #4: data could be returned yet not available
	 Look into what null, undefined might mean
Discover Unknown Unknown #5: That speed/heading can be manually
	 calculated
Discover Unknown Unknown #6: that iOS gives a 65m accuracy is a known
	 problem with a known solution
Discover Unknown Unknown #7: a decision to code for or abandon older
	 devices that don't offer speed/heading
Manual code for calculating bearing taken from StackExchange
Manual code for calculating distance taken from StackExchange
Prove we can obtain data from hardware via OS. Now also prove
      we can calculate missing heading and speed if necessary.
1742
Solve Unknown unknown #2 by scping from 'live' machine to local repo
Add first three files of actual code, plagiarised as they are.
Decide the maths should be client-side not server-side
Decide the TFL API will support position and radius for searching
       bus stop locations
Reassess project in light of answers to known unknowns and
	 unknown unknowns and conclude no need to change what
	 constitutes success.
Create docs/Todo

2216
Consider phase 3: implementation
Implement core: receive data and process it ready for output

23 April 2017
Replace faked prediction with actual prediction
Discover Unknown Unknown #9: Use of term Heading vs Bearing, resolve
	 by using "Angle" instead
Discover Unknown Unknown #10: position.timestamp is milliseconds since
	 epoch.
Discover Unknown Unknown #11: handling timestamp not available
Discover Unknown Unknown #12: Can JS handle the number 253402300799000
	 which representst the millisecond time for 9999-12-31
	 23:59:59
Effective vs efficient code
Consider that there's an object lurking here
