Unknown Unknowns

These items were unexpected at the beginning of the project and
either caused immediate workload before it could be passed, or
could cause potential workload in later improving the project.

20 April 2017
1. An admin email address for configuring Apache for subdomain
   [closed]

21 April 2017
2. What configuration sees the server only retrieve certain files
   from github
   [closed] we'll scp from the dev server to the development repo

3. Accuracy is available as well as position, speed and heading.
   This info might impact how we calculate things
   [closed] address as part of the review after phase 2

4. "null", "undefined" and "0" having specific meanings
   null = "I know what you mean but its not available"
   undefined = "I don't know what you mean"
   [closed]

5. Speed and heading could be manually calculated from a timed
   series of positions, where the data isn't otherwise available.
   [closed]

6. iPhone/iPad wouldn't give an accuracy below 65m in a test.

   [closed]

7. Older devices do not have speed/heading: continuing means
   writing code specifically to estimate both where the device
   cannot give it, or abandoning old devices altogether.
   [closed] decide to write code

8. More accurately accounting for location.
   [closed] to go into docs/Todo

9. Are "heading" and "bearing" interchangable? Reassess and if
   required, rewrite to use just one term
   [x] Not interchangable, rewrite to use "Angle" instead

10. Is the position.timestamp in seconds?
    [x] No: milliseconds since epoch

11. Handle of the position.timestamp is not present in the
    position
    [x] Unless a reasonable value, replace with own ts

12. Can JS safely store and process 253402300799000?
    [x] yes: JS will go to 1.7976931348623157e+308

13. Should we handle sanity failures differently? End the entire
    program? Skip just that position?
    [ ]

14: Can apache do the reverse proxying needed?
    [x] yes
