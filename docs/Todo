1. More accurately account for location.
Use best fit analysis over a series of readings might offer a more
accurate way to obtain coords

2. Response differently depending on accuracy
If the accuracy is 1400m, I may just want to skip predicting where
I'll be and go right ahead to discovering bus stops in the nearest
1400m.
Or, could tell user to wait until accuracy is better.
Or if 65m AND iOS, suggest user looks at location services allowed

3. Improve handling of milliseconds timestamp being divided by
   1000 to discover seconds

4. Where's the object? Pushing the position on to the stack
   automatically updating the various others, rather than processing
   one thing after another.

5. Have local stops link to each other

6. Have Apache try to RewriteRule to add app_key etc, then proxy
   pass again

7. Call API for bus stops in local mile once, then scan that per the
   prediction and range. Lightens load on API

8. Utilise OS speed and head if avail

9. expire bus stop list faster when travelling at speed

10. nearer icons larger than further icons
