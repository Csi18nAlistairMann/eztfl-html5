=====================================================

1. More accurately account for location.
Use best fit analysis over a series of readings might offer a more
accurate way to obtain coords

2. Response differently depending on accuracy
If the accuracy is 1400m, I may just want to skip predicting where
I'll be and go right ahead to discovering bus stops in the nearest
1400m.
Or, could tell user to wait until accuracy is better.
Or if 65m AND iOS, suggest user looks at location services allowed

3. Improve handling of milliseconds timestamp being divided by
   1000 to discover seconds
